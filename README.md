# D2NG-Loader
Diablo II Next Gen Loader allowing starting modders to load their custom DLL(s) without the need of patching Fog or D2Win, also preventing access violation and weird behavior. 

### How to use
It's user friendly and very simple.
- **1) Once the software is open all the DLL's that aren't the game DLL's will appear in the Listbox (Select Your Custom DLL).**

- **2) Now select your DLL and click "Add" Button, if you wish to remove it, select it in the "Custom DLL To Load" ListBox then click "Remove" Button.**

- **3) Finally at the bottom you can pass any argument you wish to pass to Game.exe such as -w for windowed, -3dfx, -ns etc...**

- **The Settings are saved to remember your choice <3**
